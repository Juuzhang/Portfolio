        <h1>Summary</h1>

        <p class="paragraph">During one of my semesters in Simon Fraser University, there was a course named <em>Moving Images</em> where students were partnered up with businesses to create videos for their events, promotions, and commercials. The task that my group and I were involved with was with the Museum of Vancouver- filming for a documentary about taxidermy for their upcoming event <a href="https://museumofvancouver.ca/wild-things">The Wild Things.</a></p>

          <p class="paragraph"><strong>My task was to lead the group, organize filming dates, edit a-roll and b-roll (by colour correcting, editing exposure and contrasts, syncing audio and footage, and suitable footage), check and clean equipment to ensure a smooth video production, and ensure quality control overall as a whole.</strong>
        </p>

        <h1>Process</h1>

        <p class="paragraph">With set and limited dates in mind for conducting interviews and visiting site location, our time was precious. Planning down to the smallest detail and goals in mind, I handled the time management, plans, negotiations, and equipment
          plans. As the most knowledgable person about dslrs and their video quality, I directed and made sure all of the cameras were functional.

        <h1>Challenges</h1>
        <p class="paragraph">As we were given only two meeting days (8 hours) to conduct and film our interviews, gather a-roll and b-roll, and be introduced in a randomized order of taxidermy, we had to act efficient and on our feet. Some of the specimens mentioned
          over e-mails and phone calls may have issues or become too brittle to be moved from it's stored location. From travelling long distances to the Museum of Vancouver with lots of big backpacks, suitcases, and hand held bags, we were
          determined and prepared to film with what ever the curators had in store for us. </p>

        <h1>Reflection</h1>
        <p class="paragraph">With the limited amount of time, I've lead our team to be efficient, functional, and up to speed with the equipment and software needed to complete the final documentary on time. Learning about the different aspects of videography and
          cinematics of storytelling guided me in the direction of visual design and hierarchy. Order and organization has shown its out most importance through this project, and it will carry with me through my projects.</p>
