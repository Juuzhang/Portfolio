        <h1>summary</h1>

        <p>An interactive mobile application development was the goal for the team to achieve. Here, I was tasked with the visual aspects, the copywriting, and user experience research - assisting in user interface design. The most important task was
          to collect data and implement ways the user can achieve their goals in an intuitive manner.
        </p>

        <h1>user experience research</h1>

        <p>My main objective in this project was to enhance user experience designing methods and paths users can take to get to their end goals, and tailoring to their needs to reach other goals. Interviewing strangers, family, and friends, I came
          up with three miniature personas with a summary of their end-goals and experience goals.

        <h1>research results</h1>
        <p>After interviewing drivers, I looked into parking issues that occurred in Vancouver. In my findings, I discovered that the reason why drivers do not usually plan ahead for parking is because by law, each building has designated parking
          spaces determined by its height and width. But then it raises the question:</p>

        <ul class="skills">
          <li><strong>"What if the parking lot was full due to events?"</strong></li>
          <li><strong>"What if the parking space only allowed a limited amount of time?"</strong></li>
          <li><strong>"What if the driver wanted alternatives other than the expensive parking provided?"</strong></li>
        </ul>


        <p>An example of this happening primitively is at Vancouver's Playland, also know as the Pacific National Exhibition. PNE offers all day parking at one of its parking lots for $13.00, however, the locals who live by the neighbourhood would take their lawn chairs out and advertise their driveways for parking for much cheaper. Another question then arises, <strong>"How many driveways are unused throughout the day?"</strong></p>

        <p>According to a Metro Vancouver study, <strong>“In every 1,600 households and parking garages of 80 apartments, only 60-70% of stalls in renter-only buildings are used.”</strong> To tackle these problems and provide a more advanced way of renting out a person's driveway, we've come up with Parkaid.</p>
