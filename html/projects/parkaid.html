        <h1>summary</h1>

        <p class="paragraph">An interactive mobile application development was the goal for the team to achieve. Here, <strong>I was tasked with the visual aspects, the copywriting, user experience research, assisting in user interface design, and
            mainly the interaction design.</strong> The most important task was
          to collect data and implement ways the user can achieve their goals in an intuitive manner.
        </p>

        <h1>user experience research</h1>

        <p class="paragraph">My main objective in this project was to enhance user experience designing methods and paths users can take to get to their end goals, and tailoring to their needs to reach other goals. Interviewing strangers, family, and
          friends, I came
          up with three miniature personas with a summary of their end-goals and experience goals.

        <h1>research results</h1>
        <p class="paragraph">After interviewing drivers, I looked into parking issues that occurred in Vancouver. In my findings, I discovered that the reason why drivers do not usually plan ahead for parking is because by law, each building has
          designated parking
          spaces determined by its height and width. But then it raises the question:</p>

        <ul class="skills">
          <li><strong>"What if the parking lot was full due to events?"</strong></li>
          <li><strong>"What if the parking space only allowed a limited amount of time?"</strong></li>
          <li><strong>"What if the driver wanted alternatives other than the expensive parking provided?"</strong></li>
        </ul>


        <p class="paragraph">An example of this happening primitively is at Vancouver's Playland, also know as the Pacific National Exhibition. PNE offers all day parking at one of its parking lots for $13.00, however, the locals who live by the
          neighbourhood would
          take their lawn chairs out and advertise their driveways for parking for much cheaper. Another question then arises, <strong>"How many driveways are unused throughout the day?"</strong></p>

        <p class="paragraph">According to a Metro Vancouver study, <a href="http://www.metrovancouver.org/services/regional-planning/PlanningPublications/Apartment_Parking_Study_TechnicalReport.pdf"><em>“In every 1,600 households and parking garages
              of 80 apartments,
              only 60-70% of stalls in renter-only buildings are used.”</em></a> To tackle these problems and provide a more advanced way of
          renting out a person's driveway, we've come up with Parkaid.</p>

      <div class="column2">
        <p class="paragraph">An issue we had was that <strong>our main screen was overwhelming</strong>, and wasn't geared towards beginners and novice users when using our application for the first time. In order to correct this, <strong>I was in
            charge of the
            interactions and visual design of the onboarding feature.</strong></p>

        <p class="paragraph">This way, beginners and novices won't feel incompetent and also further understand our application instead of seeking the answers themselves. The four steps implemented are:</p>

        <ul class="skills">
          <li><strong>Learning the map icons</strong></li>
          <li><strong>What icons are going to pop up when an icon is clicked</strong></li>
          <li><strong>What the bottom menu bar has in store</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Filters used for the map</strong></li>
        </ul>

        <p class="paragraph">In doing so, the user will have a general overview and understanding of what this application can do before exploring the application for themselves.</p>

      <div class="column2">

        <p class="paragraph">Separating our user's needs into <strong>three main features</strong>, the amount of information is both condensed visually and yet pact with a variety of options to fit the user's needs and concerns. </p>

        <p class="paragraph">The map view is for the user's simplest needs of finding quick parking before setting out to their destination, the reservation page is for users who want to secure parking ahead of time and plan their trip accordingly,
          and the posting page is for users who want to put their driveways up for rent. The three main features are:</p>

        <ul class="skills">
          <li><strong>The Map tab to view available parking in an area</strong></li>
          <li><strong>The Reservation Listings tab to reserve a parking space ahead of time</strong></li>
          <li><strong>The Postings tab to host a parking space</strong></li>

        </ul>

      <div class="column2">

        <p class="paragraph">As the user selects a parking spot on the map, <strong>the application will provide the user an estimated time from point A to B, a live map view of the area it is, what environment the parking area is in, the address,
            what time to what time they are parking from, what are the reviews of the area, and which car they are using to reserve that area.</strong> By presenting this information ahead of time, users can understand the parking space fully before
          reserving and navigating to the area.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">For free parking areas, we do not allow the user to reserve parking, however we provide information of public restrictions, conditions, and address to the parking space. We also cannot tell the user whether or not the
          area is already full unless it has a parking meter. Free parking is only provided to give the user a sense of the area and an alternative if they wish to check the area out.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">A small feature within the parkade's reservation is the parkade view, where users can view the spots taken and how many spots are available within each floor. As the map view updates live through Wi-Fi, users can get a
          sense of how busy
          the parkade is. My main questions to be answered with this interaction was:</p>

        <ul class="skills">
          <li><strong>If partnerships with malls were made, how can a driver use our application to find a parking spot?</strong></li>
          <li><strong>How will the driver find a parking spot in the mall parking lot?</strong></li>
          <li><strong>The Postings tab to host a parking space</strong></li>
          <li><strong>The Account tab for the user to view their postings and reservations and user settings.</strong></li>
        </ul>

      <h1>Reflection</h1>
      <p class="paragraph">
        The experience with developing an application from scratch emphasized the importance of how even the smallest interactions played with how the user will enjoy our application and how intuition can play a major role. This project taught me
        that an abundance of information could be solved and condensed into certain features. Researching and interviewing drivers gave me an incredible insight of how many problems, questions, and concerns people have for even the smallest things.
        Although there are many hidden features within the application, the conversation between us designers and the users becomes more intimidate.
